# Forced-Response-of-TEM
Additional documents, models, and programs concerning the paper "Forced Response of Thermoelectric Materials and Devices" are available in the file attached, ready to download.

TEM_Test_Method_XXI_20062021.ino file contains the code ready to either compile in Arduino UNO Module or in Arduino IDE.  And is possible to generate a log file .txt, as the shown in Log_TEM_XXI_12042021_15.8V_7.6_VII_Sample_Graph2.txt file.  

TEC_Model_II_ForcedResponse_Wth_Experimental_71.6V_1.13sec_Thermal_ Really_Final.sch file contains the model of the TEM in Pspice (Orcad Family Relaese 9.2)

A picture of the implementation is available: 20220108_192128.jpg
